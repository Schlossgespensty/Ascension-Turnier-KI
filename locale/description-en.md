# The Pioneer



The pioneer had always harbored the ambition to achieve something great. As soon as he heard of the success of the crusade, he gathered his few subordinates and set out to try his luck in the Holy Land. Now, in the middle of no manâ€™s land, full of drive and determination, he has begun to establish a settlement to make his dream come true. Only time will tell what he is truly capable of.
